Project Clarifications and Hints

If a page is reached without the appropriate type of request (eg, the “Product Order” page
reached without coming from a link from the “Products Browsing” page) a message should
inform the user that the request is invalid.
Notice how database constraints can simplify your coding.


Requirements and assumptions:

Read carefully the project requirements.
A few options are open-ended. For example, the requirements are open-ended on whether the
search should be case-sensitive or case-insensitive. You may make your own common sense
assumptions about these open-ended options. However 
o do not make assumptions that contradict the project requirements. For example, it is
unacceptable to introduce an assumption that “the category name need not be unique”,
since the project requirements imply the opposite.
o do not make assumptions that go against obvious common sense.
o your application must be compatible with your stated assumptions.


Deliverables: You will need to submit before the deadline a zip file with the following content:

1. A text file describing any assumptions you have made.
2. The E/R diagram for the database of Project 1. Draw the E/R diagram on Powerpoint or Visio.
3. A wire diagram of the web application pages, along the format discussed in class under “Model
1” programming. Draw the wire diagram on Powerpoint or Visio.
4. The complete code, including the .sql file that you used to create the tables of the database.
The TAs will provide instructions on where to upload the zip file.
Soon after the deadline you will meet one of the TAs to demo and answer questions about your project.
The TAs will provide instructions on how to book a time with them. The questions will include “how did
you code …” questions and many of them will lead to code inspection and database design inspection.
The entire team should be present at the demo and every member of the team should be able to
answer any question, regardless of whether she/he is the member that wrote the code pertaining to the
question. A team member that does not appear at the demo will receive 0 points, even if the other team
members receive full points. That is, before the demo, each team should do database design review and
code review, so that every member is aware of the code base.
Note that we utilize software for detecting highly similar submissions and detect potential cases of
cheating
